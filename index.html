	//step 1: parse the array in ANCESTRY_FILE
	//this creates an array of objects
	//each object will have the following keys: name, sex, born, died, father, mother
	var ancestry = JSON.parse(ANCESTRY_FILE);
	//step 1: create an object byName for each of the ancestry array element
	//the key will be the array object name
	//the value will be the object itself
	var byName = {};

	//if the object mother key value is null or if object byName with mother key does not exist
	//it gets filtered out
	var reduceMom = function(person){
		if(byName[person.mother] != null) return person

	//step 4: create a function to get the difference between the year the person is born and the year mother is born
	//note: object byName is used to point to the mother object
	var ageMomDiff = function(p){

		var momBorn = byName[p.mother].born;
		return born - momBorn;
	}
	//finally, we use a technique called compose to combine array methods
	//filter method calls step 2 function
	//map method calls step 3 function
	//this creates an array of age difference of object with mother born year and element born keys
	//the result array is called to
